### Navigating Project Directory:

#### Executive Summary
IMDB lists the credits for television shows and films produced in the U.S. and internationally. IMDB lists everyone credited on a production. This includes the talent, directors, editors, and camera operators, set designers, make-up artists, production assistants and anyone else listed in a filmâ€™s credits. IMDB excludes credits for commercial advertising and non-professional work such as student and amateur films and home videos.

The goal of the project is to build a KNN model to predict the sentiment (positive or negative) of movie reviews. 


#### Data 

Details on how to download datasets to run this project:
The dataset is originally hosted here: http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/
This is a dataset for binary sentiment classification containing substantially more data than previous benchmark datasets. We provide a set of 25,000 highly polar movie reviews for training, and 25,000 for testing. There is additional unlabeled data for use as well. Raw text and already processed bag of words formats are provided.
